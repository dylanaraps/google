## Remake of Google.com in HTML/SCSS

### Live Here: http://therealvdeadline.github.io/google

I recreated google's homepage for an assignment on http://www.theodinproject.com/

I'm aware that the site isn't an exact clone of google's homepage, I didn't want to make it an exact copy. I wanted to change the way parts of the page looked.

Benefits of making it from scratch:

* **Uses Flexbox** I've used flexbox to center the content and keep the footer stuck to the bottom.

* **Responsive** The site is responsive and works down to 320x480px.

### Goals

~~I'm happy with how the clone looks and I want to now focus on making the site functional. Meaning when you enter a search term it loads a real google page with the results.~~

My clone is now functional!
