## Remake of Google.com in HTML/SCSS

I'm remaking google's homepage for an assignment on http://www.theodinproject.com/

* **Uses Flexbox** I've used flexbox to center the content and keep the footer stuck to the bottom.

* **Responsive** The site is responsive and works down to 320x480px.

### Goals

I'm happy with how the clone(?) looks and I want to now focus on making the site functional. Meaning when you enter a search term it loads a real google page with the results.
