I'm going to University this year to learn Web development. I'm starting this blog to tell you about the rollercoaster that is my life.</p><p>I created this blog from scratch using HTML and Sass as a learning exercise. I've taking inspiration and learnt from other websites like <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://zerosixthree.se/">zerosixthree</a> and <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com">Web Designer Depot</a>. The code for my blog isn't perfect and I'm writing all of my posts straight into html files but it's a start.</p><p>I'm a pc gamer and my favourite game is <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/">Counter-Strike Global Offensive</a>. I used to play CS:GO so often that it consumed me, all I would do is play all day.</p><img src="../img/posts/myblog/csgo.png" class="responsive-image" alt="csgo hours played"> <span class="image-caption">CS:GO Consuming me.</span><p>That all changed when my family opened a Greek Cafe in Rye Victoria. The cafe was called "Yiayia's" and it quickly became my life. I made coffee, cooked souvlaki and made the only <b>Real</b> Frappe on the Peninsula.</p><img src="../img/posts/myblog/yiayias.jpg" class="responsive-image" alt="yiayias image"> <span class="image-caption">Front of Yiayia's Greek Cafe.</span><p>The cafe was a huge confidence boost for me, I did things I wouldn't have expected to, spoke to people I never would've spoken too and I'm now on the Comitee of the <a href="http://www.mornpen.vic.gov.au/Whats_On/News/Business_group_for_Rye_beach">Rye Business Association.</a></p><p>The cafe closed down a couple of months ago.</p></article></main><footer class="site-footer"><div class="container"><a href="https://github.com/therealvdeadline" class="icon-github">Github</a> <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealvdeadline" class="icon-steam" class="icon-steam">Steam</a> <a href="mailto:contact@dylanaraps.com" class="icon-mail" class="icon-steam">Email</a></div><div class="site-footer-copyright"><div class="container"><p>Dylan Araps 2015</p></div></div></footer></body>
